My very first page built completely from scratch.

HTML - CSS - FLEXBOX

STRUCTURE
- Header
	- Navbar
	- First section with short text on the left, a sign-up button and an image on the right
- Second section: title and 4-5 square images with text below
- Third section: just some text
- Footer

Project is subject to change if I find some inspirations online. 

Let's begin!
